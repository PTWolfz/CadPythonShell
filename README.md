## Introduction

This is obviously a fork of [RevitPythonShell](https://github.com/architecture-building-systems/revitpythonshell), bringing an IronPython interpreter to Autodesk Autocad,
and it would not be possible without the great work of everyone involved with the RPS project. It's still pretty rough around the edges and provides only basic functionality at this time. I'm sharing my work so far, in the hopes that together we can expand it further.

The CADPythonShell (CPS) ,lets you to write plugins for Autocad in Python, provides you with an interactive shell that lets you see the results of your code *as you type it*. This is great for exploring the Autocad API.

The biggest limitation is that you can't deploy DLLs with custom scripts at this time and you can't subscribe to events at startup time.

## Features

- Interactive IronPython interpreter for exploring the API
  - With syntax highlighting and autocompletion (in the console only)
  - Based on the [IronLab](http://code.google.com/p/ironlab/) project
- Batteries included! (Python standard library is bundled as a resource in the `CADRuntime.dll`)
- Full access to the .NET framework and the Autocad and Civil3D API
- Configurable "environment" variables that can be used in your scripts
- Save "external scripts" for reuse and start collecting your awesome hacks!
- Run scripts at Autocad or Civil startup
- Full **Snoop** info object Autocad or Civil3D (Database,Editor,Entity,etc,..)
- Interactive Snoop from console with IronPython
## Installation

- Download last install stable(msi) from [Release](https://github.com/chuongmep/CADPythonShell/releases/latest)
- Use command `PythonConsole` to open Console or use command `PythonShellSetting` to open form setting
- See guide install detail at [How-to-Install-CadPythonShell](https://github.com/chuongmep/CadPythonShell/wiki/How-to-Install-CadPythonShell)

Note : Support for 5 last version(2019-2023) Autocad or Civil 3D. Older versions can be used but will not guarantee the expected performance.

#### Use Snoop In Python Shell Console

- <kbd>sn.Snoop(obj)</kbd> - Snoop Object by Python Console In CAD or Civil3D
- <kbd>snoop(obj)</kbd> - Snoop Object by Python Console or Execute python code In CAD or Civil3D

#### Write Console Sample

``` py
ed = doc.Editor
ed.WriteMessage("Hello")
```
![](Images/console.gif)

- Try create script get Object

```py
import clr
import sys
sys.path.append('C:\Program Files (x86)\IronPython 2.7\Lib')
import os
import math
clr.AddReference('acmgd')
clr.AddReference('acdbmgd')
clr.AddReference('accoremgd')
# Import references from AutoCAD
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.Runtime import *
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.ApplicationServices import *
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.EditorInput import *
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.DatabaseServices import *
from Autodesk.AutoCAD.Geometry import *
adoc = Application.DocumentManager.MdiActiveDocument
ed = adoc.Editor
with adoc.LockDocument():
	with adoc.Database as db:
		with db.TransactionManager.StartTransaction() as t:
  			bt = t.GetObject(db.BlockTableId, OpenMode.ForWrite)
  			btr = t.GetObject(bt[BlockTableRecord.ModelSpace], OpenMode.ForWrite)
  			for objectid in btr:
				obj1 = t.GetObject(objectid, OpenMode.ForRead)
				print(obj1)
ed.WriteMessage("Done")
```
